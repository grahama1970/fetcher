Below are the remaining domains whose URLs were still
  flagged as paywalled in sparta/data/run_artifacts/
  outstanding_urls_summary.20251112-174355.json. I’ve listed
  every URL for each domain so you can decide whether we should
  whitelist them (treat as always accessible) or keep treating
  them as genuine paywalls.

  _Note:_ Every fetcher batch now emits a machine-readable
  run/artifacts/outstanding_domains_summary.json alongside the
  legacy summaries. Use that JSON for the up-to-date list of
  unresolved URLs; the notes below remain as historical context.

  Please let me know, domain by domain (or URL by URL if you
  prefer), whether to:

  1. Add to the safe-domain allowlist so paywall detection
     skips them, or
  2. Continue treating them as paywalled so the alternate
     resolver keeps working on substitutes.

  Once I have your decisions, I’ll update PAYWALL_SAFE_DOMAINS,
  adjust detector heuristics if needed, and rerun the
  regression tests.
