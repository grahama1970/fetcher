Fetcher project update:

  - Sparta no longer ships its own fetcher/paywall
    implementations. The files in sparta/workflows/
    {alternate_urls,fetcher,fetcher_config,paywall_detector,pre
    filters,html_normalize,web_fetch} are now compatibility
    shims that re-export the shared modules from /home/graham/
    workspace/experiments/fetcher/src/fetcher/workflows/. If
    you need to compare old vs. new logic, grab the previous
    versions straight from git history, e.g. git show HEAD~1
    -- sparta/workflows/fetcher.py (or use the backups
    under .backups/). Please keep all future fetcher/paywall
    changes in the standalone fetcher repo so both projects
    stay in sync.

  Documentation refreshed:

  - Added a fetcher migration note under “Primary (workflows)”
    in sparta/docs/COPILOT_REVIEW_REQUEST.md so reviewers
    know to inspect /home/graham/workspace/experiments/fetcher
    instead of the shims.
  - Added a status banner near the top of
    sparta_workflows_code_review.md explaining that the
    referenced files are legacy copies and pointing reviewers
    to the shared fetcher repo or git history for comparisons.

  Tests:

  - uv run --no-sync pytest tests/test_paywall_detector.py
  - uv run --no-sync pytest tests/unit/test_fetcher_paywall.py

  If you need anything else documented (e.g., README callouts
  or Makefile targets) let me know.
